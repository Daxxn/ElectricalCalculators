## Electrical Calculators

Multiple calculators for my electrical projects in one place. Working on making it more extensible. The first idea was to create a "hub" like app that would launch the calculators as applets. However that makes things like passing data between them much more difficult. So.. sticking with one app.

### Current Calculators:

# 

- Basic Ohms Law
- Metric Prefix Converter
- LED Current Limiting Resistor
- Voltage Divider

### Planned Calculators:

- Buck/Boost Converters
- PCB Trace Width
- Inductance
- Capacitance
- Current Divider
- 555 Timer
